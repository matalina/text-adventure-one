# The Search for X

It is the 3121 and Earth is overpopulated.  78 billion people and growing live on the dead rock that is now Earth.  The ice caps have melted and the water that remains is polluted.  Only a giant city remains across the planet.  The governments of the twenty-first century have fallen replaced by six mega-corporations that control all aspects of life including births and deaths.  

Lives begin and end at prestige rating of zero. Every year up to your 25th birthday you receive one prestige rating just for living.  After the age of 25 your lose two prestige. A person who does nothing with their lives will be terminated at age 37, but it is possible to earn prestige through your profession or buy it if you are rich enough.  But in the same manner it is also possible to lose prestige through your failures.

A recent leak from Allied Corporation, the oldest and strongest of the megacorps, reveals they are searching for something called 'X'.  You are one of the first few to learn of this development.  Do you wish to undertake this mission?
